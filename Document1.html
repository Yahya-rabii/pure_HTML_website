<h1><center> exercices In addition to the various stretches some of the more common calisthenic exercises include:</center></h1>
<br>
<table border="9"> 
<tr><td> <EM><b>Muscle-ups</b></EM></td>
<td>One of the basic calisthenics routines. Performed by a combination routine of a pull-up followed by a dip. May be done on pullup bars or rings.<br></td>
<br>
   <tr><td><EM><b>Squat jumps</b></EM></td>
<td>Performed by entering a squatting position, then using a plyometric jumping movement to jump as high as possible.<br><br><br>
<br></td>
   <tr><td><EM><b>Front lever</b></EM></td>
<td>A front lever is performed by performing a lat pulldown of the bar with straight arms until the body is parallel to the ground, with the front of the body facing upwards. May be done on rings or pull-up bar.

<tr><td><EM><b>Push-ups</b></EM></td>
<td>Performed face down on the floor, palms against floor under the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position, while avoiding resting on the floor. Chest, shoulders, and triceps are trained with this exercise.<br>
<br></td>
   <tr><td><EM><b>Pull-ups</b></EM></td>
<td>An overhead bar (sometimes called a chin-up bar) is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin level with the bar, and keeping the back straight throughout. The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the lats or upper back muscles, as well as the forearms. An underhand grip variation or chin-up trains both the back and biceps.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Chin-ups</b></EM></td>
<td>Similar to pull-ups but the hand placement is reversed. The palms of the hands are facing the person as they pull up their body using the chin-up bar. The chin-up focuses on the biceps muscles, rather than the Latissimus dorsi muscle which is the focus of the pull-up.<br></td>
<tr><td><EM><b>Squats</b></EM></td>
<td>Standing with feet shoulder width apart, the subject squats down as far as possible, bringing the arms forward parallel to the floor. The subject then returns to standing position. Squats train the quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, and gluteal muscles.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Back lever</b></EM></td>
<td>A back lever is performed by lowering from an inverted hang from rings or bar, until the gymnast's body is parallel to the ground and facing towards the floor.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Handstand</b></EM></td>
<td>A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Dips</b></EM></td>
<td>Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and deltoids, especially the anterior portion.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Hyperextensions</b></EM></td>
<td>Performed in a prone position on the ground, the individual raises the legs, arms and upper body off the ground.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Leg raises</b></EM></td>
<td>Lying on the back, hands in fists under buttocks, move feet up and down.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Planks</b></EM></td>
<td>This is the name for holding the 'top' position of a push-up for extended periods of time. The primary muscle involved in this exercise is the rectus abdominis.<Br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>Burpees</b></EM></td>
<td>A full body calisthenics workout that works abdominal muscles, chest, arms, legs, and some parts of the back.<br></td>
<br>
<tr><td><EM><b>L-sit</b></EM></td>
<td>The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable (L) shape, hence the name (L-sit). The L sit requires you to keep your core tensed and hold your legs horizontal so your body sits in a perfect 'L' position. This requires significant abdominal strength and a high level of hamstring flexibility.
